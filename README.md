# PHPAS2

This is a reimplementation of the AS2SecureCode library from [www.as2secure.com](http://www.as2secure.com/).

The main purpose of this project is to bring the code up to PHP 5.6/7.0 standards as well
as create a composer-based structure for easier integration into new or existing
projects.

Any feedback, improvements, or suggestions can be submitted via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phpas2/phpas2/issues).
Feel free to fork the repository to add functionality and submit a pull-request.
